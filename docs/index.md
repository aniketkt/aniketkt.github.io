    Welcome to my corner of the internet.<br>
    Here, I share essays, ideas, and reflections — from the deeply technical to the delightfully human.

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a scientist turned engineer, drawn to the quiet intersections — where physics meets code, and people meet the tools they build. Over the years, I’ve worked on advanced sensing and metrology systems, but what I really study is how curiosity becomes craft.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I’m not doing that, I’m usually outdoors with my family, making yet another cup of coffee, or answering deep questions about the moon from a toddler who’s certain it’s following our car.
